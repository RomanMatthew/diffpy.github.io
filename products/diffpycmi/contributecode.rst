                            problems.

`diffpy.srreal`_            Python library for calculation of pair based
                            quantities such as the pair distribution
                            function (PDF), bond lengths, and bond
                            valence sums.

`diffpy.structure`_         Handles storage of crystal structure data.

`diffpy.utils`_             General purpose shared utilities for the
