PDFgetX3 version 1.2
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sources were updated to support Python 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 in addition
to Python 2.6 and 2.7.

The egg software package was enhanced to support all Python
versions.  PDFgetX3 is now distributed in a single egg file
rather than in multiple eggs per each Python version.

Added support for `IPython 5.0 <http://ipython.org>`__ with
continued compatibility for IPython 0.10 and later.

Added support for `matplotlib 2.0 <https://matplotlib.org>`__.

Changed :ref:`pdfgetx3 <cmd-pdfgetx3>` option
:option:`--force <pdfgetx3 --force>` to take
a boolean value ("yes", "no", "true", etc.) or "once".
The configuration parameter :confval:`force` can be
set to a bool or to a string ``'once'``.  This enables
safe one-time overwrite of existing output files.

The :ref:`plotdata <cmd-plotdata>` program learned a new option
:option:`--log=LOG <plotdata -L>` to set logarithmic scale
for *x* or *y* axis.  The |plotdata| function added a new
*log* argument for the same purpose.

Added *ax* argument for the |plotdata| function to select
a specific matplotlib axis for plotting.

Removed *hold* argument from the |plotdata| function,
because it was deprecated in matplotlib.

Added support for Unicode filenames and values in
the :interactvar:`config` interactive variable.

Updated plotting code to use the Unicode "Å" (Ångström) symbol in
axes labels.  The "Å" symbol is also used to denote units in output
files.

The parser of chemical formulas learned to read parentheses
and fractional stoichiometry as in ``'Pb (Ti Zr)1/2 O3'``.

The |loadData| argument *usecols* was updated to accept scalars,
open-end :py:class:`slice` objects and string-specified
slices, such as ``'1:3'`` or ``'1:'``.

The :ref:`plotdata <cmd-plotdata>` program and |plotdata|
function learned to take open-end slices for the y-columns
selection.  The plotdata utilities dropped support for
multiple x-columns.

The :ref:`pdfgetx3 <cmd-pdfgetx3>` program learned to
avoid duplicate extension ".gr.gr" when run with
:option:`--output=f.gr <pdfgetx3 -o>`.

Fixed crash on loading custom configuration section,
which is missing in global configuration file, but
is present in the local one.

Removed import of all :py:mod:`numpy` names into the
interactive session.  NumPy is available under the
``np`` name instead.

Corrected missing checkbox in the :any:`tuneconfig`
dialog, which was caused by a bug in matplotlib.

Added explanatory message for PDFgetX3 installed for
an incompatible Python version.

The IPython magic function :ref:`%pdfgetx3 <my-pdfgetx3-magic>`
was changed to set ``_exit_code`` as do the shell commands
run from IPython.

Inline documentation adopted NumPy-style Napoleon format,
which is human readable and can be included in the manual.

The software package files and documentation were updated
to build in a binary reproducible way.
