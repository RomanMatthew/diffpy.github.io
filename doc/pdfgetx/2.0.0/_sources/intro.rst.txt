Introduction
========================================================================

diffpy.pdfgetx is a simple yet powerful software for converting X-ray
or neutron powder diffraction data to atomic Pair Distribution Functions
(PDFs).  The software includes command line programs PDFgetX3 and
PDFgetN3 for processing X-ray and constant-wavelength neutron
diffraction data respectively.  PDFgetX3 and PDFgetN3 can be used in
a batch mode to convert a series of data files without user
intervention.  The programs can be also run in an interactive
mode that allows to control process parameters and plot the PDFs
and any intermediate results.  Users can interactively tune the
PDF processing parameters, visualize their effect on the results and
adjust them to their optimum values.  The programs are bundled with
Python library diffpy.pdfgetx for PDF processing functions, which
can be used in custom Python scripts.
